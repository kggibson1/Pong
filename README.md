Learning Godot logic by following along this YouTube tutorial by Clear code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr1BoEbuveI&t=70s

Finished working on this for now, there are a few things I would change now I have finished but this was just for learning the basics of Godot and GDScript. I have found its extremely similar to Python.

Things I would change:

1. Reset paddle position at the beginning of each round as some glitchy physics sometimes goes on and the ball shifts the paddles positions.

2. Actually align the text in the screen properly instead of just free handing it.

3. Randomise the projection angle of the ball better instead of hard coding a range of angles that the ball can eject between.
